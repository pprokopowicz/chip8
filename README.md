# Chip8

My version of Chip8 interpreter written in Zig.

## Usage

To run use the following command:

```console
foo@bar:~$ zig build run -- <PATH_TO_ROM>
```

## Notes

Prerequisite to running is having [SDL3](https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL) installed. As far as I know Linux should have it out of the box, on macOS use homebrew to install.


Currently tested on macOS and Linux.
